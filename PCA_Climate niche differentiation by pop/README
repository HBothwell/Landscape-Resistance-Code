This code runs a principal component analysis (PCA) to assess whether genetic populations are significantly differentiated in multivariate climate space.  Data are from a collection of 763 narrowleaf cottonwood trees (P. angustifolia) sampled across their range from southern Arizona to Alberta, Canada.  Code generates PCA ordination plots overlaid with SE or SD ellipses and climate vectors.  Significance is assessed with perMANOVA.
